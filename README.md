# ToDoList-Django

Project Description: To Do List using Django

In this project, we will be building a simple To Do List application using the Django web framework. The application will allow users to create and manage their to-do tasks. Users can add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks that are no longer needed.

The To Do List application will have a simple user interface with a list of tasks and buttons for adding, completing, and deleting tasks. The application will also have a form for adding new tasks and a search bar for searching through the list of tasks.

To build this application, we will be using Django's built-in models to create a Task model that will define the attributes of each task. We will also use Django's views and templates to create the user interface for the application.

To implement the functionality of the application, we will use Django's class-based views to handle user actions such as adding, completing, and deleting tasks. We will also use Django's form handling capabilities to validate user input when adding new tasks.

To ensure that the application is secure and protected against malicious attacks, we will use Django's built-in authentication and authorization mechanisms. This will allow us to restrict access to certain parts of the application to only authorized users.

Overall, the To Do List application will be a simple but useful tool for managing tasks and staying organized. It will showcase the power and flexibility of the Django web framework in building web applications quickly and efficiently.
